This is a sample project about Network testing and how we can test networking code in a Swift project. In this sample project we fetch the Top 10 Audio Podcasts  and present them on a table view. We are able test our view model classes by injecting a mock network client. Both the remote network client as well as the mock one conform to the `RemoteRequestExecutable`  protocol. We inject an instance of `LocalClient` on the viewModel that we want to test which reads the expected response from the bundle. There is also an `ErrorClient` which returns errors in order to test the error handling of the viewModel as well.
